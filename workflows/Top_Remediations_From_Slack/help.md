## Setup

Import the workflow from the Rapid7 Extension Library and proceed through the Import Workflow wizard in InsightConnect. Import plugins, create or select connections, and rename the workflow as a part of the Import Workflow wizard as necessary.

After import, activate the workflow in order to trigger it.

### Usage

*This workflow will trigger in any direct messages to your Chatbot **or** any message in a channel directed @ your Chatbot. Note the Chatbot must be in the channel in order to trigger the workflow this way.*

To run the workflow, send a direct message to your InsightConnect Slack Chatbot or @ your Chatbot in a channel starting with the command `top-remediations`, followed by the type (`asset`, `group`, `site`, or `tag`) and the name of the target.

For example, in a direct message to your Chatbot:
* top-remediations asset hostname123
* top-remediations group Windows Servers
* top-remediations site DMZ
* top-remediations tag John

Or in a channel including your Chatbot:
* @Rapid7 InsightConnect top-remediations asset win8s1
* @Rapid7 InsightConnect top-remediations group SQL
* @Rapid7 InsightConnect top-remediations site Headquarters
* @Rapid7 InsightConnect top-remediations tag Very High

The workflow will post the top 10 remediation steps for the specified entity to the Slack channel where the command was triggered.
