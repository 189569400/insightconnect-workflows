# Description

This workflow will quarantine and unquarantine an endpoint in SentinelOne from a Slack command. This workflow supports endpoints in the form of Agent IDs, hostnames, MAC addresses, or IP addresses.

Sample Slack Trigger Commands:

`@Rapid7 InsightConnect quarantine-endpoint 198.51.100.100`

`@Rapid7 InsightConnect unquarantine-endpoint 198.51.100.100`

Under the "Endpoints" tab from the "Sentinels" page on the main menu in the SentinelOne console, the quarantined endpoint will show "Network status" as "Disabled" after being quarantined.
