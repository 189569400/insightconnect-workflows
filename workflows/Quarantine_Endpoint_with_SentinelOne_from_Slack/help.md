# Description

This workflow will quarantine and unquarantine an endpoint in SentinelOne from a Slack command. This workflow supports endpoints in the form of Agent IDs, hostnames, MAC addresses, or IP addresses.

Sample Slack Trigger Commands:

`@Rapid7 InsightConnect quarantine-endpoint 198.51.100.100`

`@Rapid7 InsightConnect unquarantine-endpoint 198.51.100.100`

Under the "Endpoints" tab from the "Sentinels" page on the main menu in the SentinelOne console, the quarantined endpoint will show "Network status" as "Disabled" after being quarantined.

## Setup

Import the workflow from the Rapid7 Extension Library and proceed through the Import Workflow wizard in InsightConnect. Import plugins, create or select connections, and rename the workflow as a part of the Import Workflow wizard as necessary.

Once the workflow has been imported, **each Slack step will need the channel name updated to suit your Slack environment!** Edit the input with the preset text of `change_me` in each Slack step in the workflow.

After configuring the Slack steps, activate the workflow in order to trigger it.
