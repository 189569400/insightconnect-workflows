# Description

Disabling a compromised account can limit the scope of an attack and buy valuable time to investigate and contain the threat. This workflow disables or enables an Azure AD account with a simple Slack command.

Sample Slack Trigger Commands:

`@Rapid7 InsightConnect disable-user-azure user@example.com`

`@Rapid7 InsightConnect enable-user-azure user@example.com`

# Key Features

* **Break the Kill Chain** - Credentials provide attackers with easy access to numerous targets. Disabling a compromised account or forcing a password reset can quickly and effectively interrupt an attackerâ€™s kill chain.
* **Buy Time to Investigate and Remediate** - In a pinch, disabling a user account can limit your threat exposure and buy your team valuable time to investigate and contain a threat. Disabling the user may not remediate the root cause, but it can mitigate the immediate risk while you work on fixing underlying issues.
* **Minimize Disruption to the User** - Forcing a user to reset their password is a small inconvenience compared to re-imaging their entire system. Acting fast can save valuable time and teach a valuable lesson without a noticeable impact to your business.

# Requirements

## Setup

Import the workflow from the Rapid7 Extension Library and proceed through the Import Workflow wizard in InsightConnect. Import plugins, create or select connections, and rename the workflow as a part of the Import Workflow wizard as necessary.

Once the workflow has been imported, **the first Slack step will need the channel name updated to suit your Slack environment!** Edit the input with the preset text of `change_me` in first Slack step in the workflow.

After configuring the Slack step, activate the workflow in order to trigger it.

### Usage

*This workflow will trigger in any direct messages to your Chatbot **or** any message in a channel directed @ your Chatbot. Note the Chatbot must be in the channel in order to trigger the workflow this way.*

To run the workflow, send a direct message to your InsightConnect Slack Chatbot or @ your Chatbot in a public channel starting with the command `disable-user-azure` or `enable-user-azure`.

For example, in a direct message to your Chatbot:
* `disable-user-azure user@example.com`
* `enable-user-azure user@example.com`

Or in a channel including your Chatbot:
* `@Rapid7 InsightConnect disable-user-azure user@example.com`
* `@Rapid7 InsightConnect enable-user-azure user@example.com`

The workflow will acknowledge the request and reply when it has completed.
