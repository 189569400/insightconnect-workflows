## Setup

Import the workflow from the Rapid7 Extension Library and proceed through the Import Workflow wizard in InsightConnect. Import plugins, create or select connections, and rename the workflow as a part of the Import Workflow wizard as necessary.

Once the workflow has been imported, **Update the first step with the channel name to suit your Slack environment!** by editing the input with the preset text of `change_me` to match the channel to monitor.

After configuring the Slack steps, activate the workflow in order to trigger it.
 
An optional whitelist can be added to the Broadcom Symantec Endpoint Protection `Quarantine` action. To use this list 
add MAC addresses or hostnames in the following format (colons or hyphens are acceptable for MAC addresses) `["00:A0:C9:14:C8:29", "example-host"]`

### Usage

To run the workflow, @ your Slack chatbot starting with the command `@Rapid7 InsightConnect quarantine-endpoint` or `@Rapid7 InsightConnect unquarantine-endpoint`.

Your chat bot will reply when the workflow completes.
