# Documentation

## Setup

Import the workflow from the Rapid7 Extension Library and proceed through the Import Workflow wizard in InsightConnect. Import plugins, create or select connections, and rename the workflow as a part of the Import Workflow wizard as necessary.

Once the workflow has been imported, **each Slack step will need the channel name updated to suit your Slack environment!** Edit the input with the preset text of `change_me` in each Slack step in the workflow.

After configuring the Slack steps, activate the workflow in order to trigger it.
 
An optional whitelist can be added to the Fortigate Add Host to be Blocked action. To add this list add IP's or domains in the following format `["198.51.100.100", "example.com", "198.51.100.1"]` and they will not be blocked.

By default, this workflow will automatically skip blocking private IP addresses, if youâ€™d like to block these as well, set `Skip RFC 1918` option to false in the "Add Host to be Blocked" step.

### Usage

*This workflow will only trigger in the channel specified in the Slack workflow steps.*

To run the workflow, send a message to the specified Slack channel starting with the command `@Rapid7 InsightConnect block-host`.


Your chat bot will reply when the workflow completes.
