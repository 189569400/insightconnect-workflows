## Setup

Import the workflow from the Rapid7 Extension Library and proceed through the Import Workflow wizard in InsightConnect. Import plugins, create or select connections, and rename the workflow as a part of the Import Workflow wizard as necessary.

Once the workflow has been imported, **the first Microsoft Teams step will need the team name and channel name updated to suit your Microsoft Teams environment!** Edit the input with the preset text of `change_me` in the first Microsoft Teams step in the workflow. In addition, the workflow will restrict the number of AttackerKB exploits returned based on the `max exploits` configuration in the Settings step. By default a max of 10 exploits will be returned; however, this can be modified as needed.

After updating the first Microsoft Teams step and the Settings step, activate the workflow in order to trigger it.

## Usage

*This workflow will only trigger in the channel specified in the Microsoft Teams workflow steps.*

To run the workflow, in the channel you are monitoring send a message to Insight Connect using `!lookup-vuln <search term>`.

For example:
* `!lookup-vuln CVE-2020-0674`
