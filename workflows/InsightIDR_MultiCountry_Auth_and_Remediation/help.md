# Description

This workflow is designed to respond to InsightIDR's Multi Country Authentication alert by confirming if the user authenticated from more than 2 locations. With a flux of VPN loggings,a way to automatically reduce false positives would be to close alerts that have 2 or less locations or automatically respond to alerts with more than 2 locations. I this workflow, InsightConnect is responding by disabling the user account associated with more than 2 locations. 

# Key Features

* If locations are 2 or less, the InsightIDR investigation is automatically closed.
* If there are more than 2 locations Active Directory is automatically querying for the associated user. If the user is found, they are disabled.
