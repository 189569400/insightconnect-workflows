# Documentation

## Setup

Import the workflow from the Rapid7 Extension Library and proceed through the Import Workflow wizard in InsightConnect. Import plugins, create or select connections, and rename the workflow as a part of the Import Workflow wizard as necessary.

For this workflow you need to install and configure the [InsightConnect Slack App](https://docs.rapid7.com/insightconnect/configure-slack-for-chatops/).

After import, activate the workflow in order to trigger it.

### Usage

*To limit the risk of users sharing malicious URLs in Slack channels, this workflow will ONLY trigger on direct messages to your Chatbot.*

To run the workflow, send a direct message to your InsightConnect Slack Chatbot starting with the command `enrich-domain`, followed by one or more URLs for enrichment.

For example:

* `enrich-domain aoldaily.com`
* `enrich-domain aoldaily.com rapid7.com`

The workflow will post the results in a thread.

You can change this behaviour by changing the "Type" field in the trigger step.
