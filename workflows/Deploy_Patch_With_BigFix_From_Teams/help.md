# Description

Deploy a patch with BigFix to a target system with a Microsoft Teams message. This workflow accepts a Patch Title and Target Host, searches BigFix for relevant fixlets, and attempts to deploy those fixlets to the Target Host. If successful, a link to the BigFix action is returned in Microsoft Teams.

# Key Features

* Deploy a specific patch to a specific system
* Receive real-time updates on workflow execution, including links to InsightConnect jobs and BigFix actions
* Keep your team in the loop when deploying hotfixes or missing patches with patching commands in a Microsoft Teams channel

# Requirements

The following connections will need to be setup: 

* HCL BigFix server URL and credentials
* Microsoft Teams

# Documentation

## Setup

Import the workflow from the Rapid7 Extension Library and proceed through the Import Workflow wizard in InsightConnect. Import plugins, create or select connections, and rename the workflow as a part of the Import Workflow wizard as necessary.

After import, activate the workflow in order to trigger it.

### Usage

*This workflow will trigger in any direct messages to your Chatbot **or** any message in a channel directed @ your Chatbot. Note the Chatbot must be in the channel in order to trigger the workflow this way.*

To run the workflow, send a direct message to your InsightConnect Chatbot or @ your Chatbot in a public channel starting with the command `deploy-patch`. The command accepts two parameters: `patch` and `target`. Input the title (may be a partial match) of the patch that should be deployed and the hostname of the target.

For example, in a direct message to your Chatbot:
* `deploy-patch patch=Title of Patch target=targetHostName`

Or in a channel including your Chatbot:
* `@Rapid7 InsightConnect deploy-patch patch=Title of Patch target=targetHostName`

Both the `patch` and `target` parameters must be specified in order to run the workflow successfully. This workflow does not support deploying multiple patches to a single target or a single patch to multiple targets.

The workflow will post status updates throughout execution. When complete, it will post a link to the resulting Action in BigFix.
