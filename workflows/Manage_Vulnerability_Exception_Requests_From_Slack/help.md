## Setup

Import the workflow from the Rapid7 Extension Library and proceed through the Import Workflow wizard in InsightConnect. Import plugins, create or select connections, and rename the workflow as a part of the Import Workflow wizard as necessary.

After import, activate the workflow. It will trigger upon newly submitted vulnerability exception requests.

NOTE: This workflow will NOT trigger on *re*submitted exception requests at this time. Please rely on conventional methods, such as talking to each other, to manage resubmissions.

## Usage

This workflow will trigger automatically on new vulnerability exception requests in the InsightVM Console.
