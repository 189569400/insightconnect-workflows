Vulnerability risk data, exclusion submitter comments, expiration dates, and more details are included in the Slack message to provide contextual details to the reviewer without the need to log into the InsightVM Console.

# Key Features

* Review vulnerability exception details in a well-formatted Slack message
* Decide to approve or reject the exception request from Slack

# Requirements

# Documentation

## Setup

Import the workflow from the Rapid7 Extension Library and proceed through the Import Workflow wizard in InsightConnect. Import plugins, create or select connections, and rename the workflow as a part of the Import Workflow wizard as necessary.

After import, edit the workflow Settings step. Change the channel name from the default `#secops` to a Slack channel of your choice. The workflow will post new vulnerability exception requests to this channel. Also adjust the `auto-threshold` variable to indicate the maximum CVSS score for which vulnerability exception requests will be automatically approved. To ensure no exception requests are approved automatically, set this value to a negative number (eg, -1). 

Once your environmental settings have been applied, activate the workflow. It will trigger upon newly submitted vulnerability exception requests.

NOTE: This workflow will NOT trigger on *re*submitted exception requests at this time. Please rely on conventional methods, such as talking to each other, to manage resubmissions.

## Usage

This workflow will trigger automatically on new vulnerability exception requests in the InsightVM Console.
