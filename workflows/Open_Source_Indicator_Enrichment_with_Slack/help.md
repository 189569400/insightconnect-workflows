# Description

Threat Intelligence doesnâ€™t have to come with a cost. This workflow uses open-source intelligence (OSINT) to perform domain lookups, header analysis, hash analysis, and more directly from Slack or Microsoft Teams. Just connect Slack and activate this instant indicator enrichment workflow.

Sample Slack Trigger Commands:

`@Security Bot !investigate ip 8.8.8.8`

`@Security Bot !investigate url badsite.com`

`@Security Bot !investigate hash 36c5012e100c8e91221e9891cad37df0cac938cee1e8f69b6fdf99821cb05339`

# Key Features

* **Automation in Minutes** - Get your first automation workflow up and running in minutes with this connectionless enrichment workflow.
* **Investigate Indicators at Scale** - Manually investigating every reported phishing attempt is extremely difficult to scale. Automatic analysis of common phishing IOCs reduces the overhead associated with every reported incident.
* **Shorten the Investigation Timeline** - Manage timely responses to real attacks by eliminating the investigation of false positives and spam. If the URLs are found to be malicious, pivot seamlessly to incident response.
