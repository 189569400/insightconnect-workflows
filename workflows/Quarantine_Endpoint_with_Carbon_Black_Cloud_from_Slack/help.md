# Description

This workflow quarantines or unquarantines endpoints with VMware Carbon Black Cloud via Slack command and reports information back to Slack.
This workflow supports endpoints in the form of Device IDs, hostnames, or IP addresses.

Sample Slack Trigger Commands:

`@Rapid7 InsightConnect quarantine-endpoint example-host`

`@Rapid7 InsightConnect unquarantine-endpoint 198.51.100.100`

To check the device quarantine status in Carbon Black Cloud, log into the Carbon Black Cloud product web interface and choose the Dndpoints page under the Inventory menu item on the left sidebar.
